# D3-Transitioning-Area-Chart-With-Thresholds

Demo :http://nicohaemhouts.github.io/D3-Transitioning-Area-Chart-With-Thresholds/

A flowing area chart using D3.js. It has two thresholds and is updated with random data every 500ms to simulate live streaming data. It adapts its width and height to the element it is applied to, but it isn't responsive (yet).
